# onlineportfolio-project

Part 2 1/2 of my Django-Python-WebDev projects.

What happened to part 3? I don't know either... these projects of mine were old and when I started out. I was young, dumb, broke, and stupid, so I think I deleted that one. BUT, I still have this project :). I made another personal website a few months after finishing my programming course, to see how much I remembered. A lot of this was still using a reference material, but I spent hours trying to code it by myself and actually did it! You may notice a lot of stylistic differences in this portfolio versus my previous one. That's because I wasn't scared now to deviate from the tutorial and was learning how to read documentation and APIs. Finding out how to read documentation really saved me because I use it daily in college. There are so many useful methods that professors don't go over but I feel are necessary to learn.
